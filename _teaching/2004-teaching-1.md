Over three quarters from Fall, 2004 through Spring, 2005, I led 5 Discussion/Lab sections (each ~25 students) for Physics 7A/B, which is an introductory undergraduate course for pre-meds and students majoring in other STEM fields aside from physics.

This course involved a one hour lecture per week (not by me), and two 2.5 hour Discussion/Lab meetings per week with me, where I facilitated students working in groups to solve problems and run lab experiments.  For the first quarter, I had a single section (5 hours/week) and the second and third quarters, I had two sections (10 hours/week).  We also provided feedback to the physics educator leads who were developing the course.
