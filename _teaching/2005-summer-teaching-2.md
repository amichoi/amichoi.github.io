I led the lab component of Astro 10, which was an introductory course in astronomy for undergraduates.  At the beginning of each meeting, I delivered a quick lecture (~30 minutes), for which I created the slides.  We then went on to observe and complete exercises using small telescopes on the rooftop of the Physics Building.
