Dark Energy Survey (DES) Deep Fields refer to a set of images and associated multi-wavelength catalogue ($ugrizJHKs$) built from Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) data.  After masking, we have 5.88 square degrees with an $i$-band depth of 26.75 (AB, $10-\sigma$, 2") and 1.6 million detected objects.  These serve as inputs into the DES photometric redshift estimation (described in [Myles, Alarcon et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08566)) as well as image simulation efforts (see [Everett et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12825) and [MacCrann et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08567)).

I developed the part of the pipeline combining the near-IR images with the optical images in preparation for the photometry measurements, including the estimation of the point spread function models. I also conducted or contributed to a wide range of the validation tests and wrote several sections in the paper.
