In my PhD, I focused on interpreting the correlation between the positions of foreground galaxies (lenses) and the weak lensing shear of background sources in the Deep Lens Survey.  This two-point correlation function is commonly known as "galaxy-galaxy lensing", and the signal is typically binned by the projected separation between lens-source pairs on the sky. At smaller separations, the signal can be related to surface mass density profiles, with the primary contribution coming from the dark matter halos within which the galaxy lenses are embedded.  At larger separations, the signal is dominated by large-scale structure.  This paper presents the main result from my PhD analysis of the Deep Lens Survey, a deep and high-resolution 20 square degree survey in <i>BVRz</i> originally designed to be a precursor to what we now know as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time that will be conducted with the Vera Rubin Observatory.
